Sorting Tasks by Priority
To sort tasks by priority, we use a simple method:

Each task has a priority that can be "high", "medium", or "low".
We assign numbers to these priorities:
High = 1
Medium = 2
Low = 3
When we sort the tasks, we compare these numbers to arrange the tasks. High-priority tasks show up first.

# Hereâ€™s how the sorting works:

const sortedTasks = [...pendingTasks].sort((a, b) => {
  const priorities = { high: 1, medium: 2, low: 3 };
  return priorities[a.priority] - priorities[b.priority];
});
